# Pine

Pine stands for **P**rozilla's game eng**ine**.
Pine is a lightweight Java game engine that serves as a framework for [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/).
Pine's main structure (especially the game objects and components systems) is heavily inspired by the Unity game engine.

As a framework, Pine makes working with the low-level LWJGL library a lot easier and more intuitive, without sacrificing control.
Because everything is split into layers of abstraction, you can choose how much of Pine's existing functionality you want to utilize 
and where you want insert your own code.
